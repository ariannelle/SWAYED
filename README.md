# SWAYED
SWAYED is an app that offers insights into popular products using AI. It consolidates real and verified customer reviews from multiple platforms, generating an average sentiment and insightful comments on products.

This app was created as a response to the promotion of viral products, which become popular overnight, but often do not function as intended. Through promotion by influencers on social media, these products are often marketed as too good to be true, and unsuspecting customers may fall victim to these false advertising practices. It consolidates real and verified customer reviews from multiple platforms, generating an average sentiment and insightful comments on products and empowers customers to make informed purchase decisions. Currently, in its demo stage, only one product page has been created.

Users can get started with the project by launching the index.html file. This displays search bar which will return the product results page, with a general assessment of the product. We also have a product insights webpage, which offers more information about the product as well as other related products. There is also the option of creating an account on the app. Please note that as of June 11th, 2023, the app functions when deployed on a local host, however we have not been able to successfully deploy it on another external host.

SWAYED was created by a team of three passionate and dedicated women: Giatri Lalla, Kira Mohammed and Arianne Baliramsingh. Thanks for checking it out!
